What is Performance Testing? Performance testing is used to perform the performance of the website before launching it in the market.
It is required for Speed, Scalability and Stability

Types of Performance Testing?

Load Testing: Tested performance at normal and peak usage. response times are checked for different user loads.

Stress Testing: How much load the system can sustain? Additional load is added gradually. Need to check how it recovers after the crash

Volume Testing: Application is tested with huge volume of data. 

Capacity Testing: Where the application is tested to meet business volumes. Need to check if they can handle future loads.

Reliability Testing: It is used to check the time required by the application to return to the normal state from abnormal state.

Scalability Testing: If the application would be required to scale up based on the future needs.

Performance testing process:

Requirement Gathering --> Selection of tools --> Performance test plan --> Execution of test --> Performance Test Modeling --> Performance Test Development --> Test Results Analysis --> Report

Requirement Gathering: Requirements are identified, gathered, architecture, number of users, functionality, Requests
Selection of tools: After POC is done we can finalize the tools.
Performance Test Plan: It is the test plan that decides how performance test will take place like workload, test environment
Performance Test Development: Use cases for functional development is taken. Setup the test environment. 
Execution of Test: Increase the load of users
test Results analaysis: 

Common Performance Bottlenecks:
CPU Utilization
Memory Utilization
Networking Utilization
S limitation
Disk usage

What is throughput in Performance testing? -- The amount of data transported to the server in response to the client request at a given time
