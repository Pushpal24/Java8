RestAssured -- 

Why is REST stateless -- REST is stateless because the server doesn't remember the previous requests. So every new requests should have all the required info for the server to understand it

What is RestAssured?  -- RestAssured is a java based library used for testing RESTful APIs. It is used to test the different REST functionalities so that API is working as expected

What is client server architecture? -- Multiple clients are connected over internet to the server or few instances of a server. When a client submits a request, the server fulfils them

What is RestAssured Method chaining? --Chaining means calling any number of methods as per the design. Variables are not required to maintain interim outcomes

Why would RestAssured utilize static import? -- It is used to simplify code by giving direct access to static methods and fields of a class without explicitly specifying the class name.

Implementation of POST Request:

   		pathParam("userName", userName)
   .when()
   		.get(get_url)
   		
How to read a response    			


What is Serialization? -- The process of converting organism's state(objects) into a stream of bytes(files) is known as serialization. 

What technique does caching use? -- It is to store the information temporally so that 

RestAssured is a class which has many static fields and methods. It supports 
POST, GET, PUT, DELETE

What is Response?
Response is an interface which provides method to obtain the payload.

Implementation method of response?

response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode()

Super Class of WebDriver/WebElement?
SearchContext is the super interface of WebDriver and WebElement interface

Implementation classes of WebDriver?
ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver, FirefoxDriver, InternetExplorerDrive

Implementation class of WebElement?
RemoteWebElement 

TakeScreenShot is an interface and getScreenshotAs is a method which comes with it

What is searchcontext in selenium?
SearchContext is the topmost interface in Selenium API which has two methods - findElement() and findElements()

Selenium WebDriver interface has many abstract methods like get(String url), quit(), close(), getWindowHandle(), getWindowHandles(), getTitle()


// TestNG

What is TestNG? -- It is automation testing framework used for Java programming language.

Advantages of TestNG? -- It generates report in a proper format
Multiple test cases can be grouped and priority can be assigned
It can be integrated with maven, jenkins
Annotations in TestNG are easily understandable

What are the sequence of execution for all annotations?
@BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod, @Test
@AfterSuite, @AfterTest, @AfterClass, @AfterMethod

What is testng.xml file used for?
It defines the order of execution of test cases
It allows to group test cases
It executes the selected test cases
It allows TestNG framework to integrate with jenkins

How to pass parameters from testNG? -- @Parameter

Difference between soft assertion and hard assertion? -- if TestNG gets an error it will throw an exception and move with the next step.. BUT in hard assertion when an assertion fails it will stop the execution
@Listener annotation is used for? TestNG provides different listeners which performs different actions whenever event is triggered

@Factory annotation is used for? -- It is used when we need to run multiple test cases through a single test class.

Difference between @Factory and @DataProvider? -- @DataProvider is used to test methods multiple number of times based on the different data provided 
@factory is used to execute the test methods present in the same test class using different instances of the respective class
